## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans1. Python is called general purpose because it can used to design and develop a wide variety of applications, across multiple domain. High-level programming language means it's more user-friendly. Coding in Python is like writing a story in English.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans2. Dynamically typed language means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing. We don't need to declare the variable type, the interpreter automatically interprets it.

```python
var = 17
```

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Ans6. By using input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans7. string

Q8. What is type casting?

Ans8. Type casting means changing the datatype of the variable. We can only type casting the datatype having higher bit value to the lower bit value.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Ans9. Yes.
```python
x, y, z = input("Enter three values: ").split(",")
print("Total number of students: ", x)
print("Number of boys is : ", y)
print("Number of girls is : ", z)
print()
```
```python
x = [int(x) for x in input("Enter multiple value: ").split(",")]
print("Number of list is: ", x) 
```
Q10. What are keywords?

Ans10. Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Ans11. Yes we can but we shoudn't as it will override the properties of the keyword.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Ans12. Indentation is the whitespace used in Python. Indentation is used to create block of statement.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Ans13. Using print() function.

Ans14. Symbols or keywords used to perform certain operations on values or variable are known as operators. There are different types of operators like
- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Assignment Operators 


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

1 or 0 -> 1
0 and 0 -> 0
True and False and True -> False
1 or 0 or 0 -> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Ans20. In large projects we have to control the flow of execution of our program and we want to execute some set of statements only if the given condition is satisfied, and a different set of statements when itâ€™s not satisfied.


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Ans21. if is the first condition check for the condition.

if "if" is False then elif's condition is checked.

else is checked when all the upper condition fails.

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?

Ans40. Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers. 
Tuples are immutable where as list are mutable. We can also faster through the tuples than the list.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?

Ans41. We can create tuple using round brackets ().

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.

Ans42. No, I can't as tuples are immutable. The work around is it typecast tuple to list and then append.
```python
tup = ()
tup = list(tup)
tup.append("Vishal")
tup = tuple(tup)
tup
```

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?

Ans43.Yes, we can.

x = tuple(x)
print(len(x))
```

Q45. What are sets in Python?

Ans45. A set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.

Q46. How can you create a set?

Ans46. We can create set using curly brackets {}. Keep in mind empty {} will result in dictionary hence there must be some value in the brackets.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?

Ans50. To remove all the elements from the set, clear() function is used.

Q51. What is frozen set?

Ans51. Frozen sets in Python are immutable objects that only support methods and operators that produce a result without affecting the frozen set or sets to which they are applied. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation. 

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

Ans52.
- Frozen sets are immutable where as sets are mutable.
- Sets can't be used as keys in dictionary where as frozen sets can be used.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.


Ans53. Python set Union() Method returns a new set which contains all the items from the original set.
```python
set1 = {2, 4, 5, 6}
set2 = {4, 6, 7, 8}
set3 = {7, 8, 9, 10}

print("set1 U set2 : ", set1 | set2)

print("set1 U set2 U set3 :", set1 |set2 | set3)
```

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.

Ans54. Python set intersection() method returns a new set with an element that is common to all set

set1 = {2, 4, 5, 6}
set2 = {4, 6, 7, 8}
set3 = {4, 6, 8}

print("set1 intersection set2 : ", set1.intersection(set2))

print("set1 intersection set2 intersection set3 :", set1.intersection(set2, set3))
```

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?

Ans55. Dictionary in Python is a collection of keys values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other data types which hold only a single value as an element.

```python
Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
print(Dict.popitem())
```
Q66. What is the use of keys() function?

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?

Ans69. There is for and while loop in Python

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?

Ans70. When we know the exact number of iterations, we can use for loop. When we want the to run till a certain condition is true we can use while loop.

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?

Ans71. Continue Statement skips the execution of the program block from after the continue statement and forces the control to start the next iteration.

Q72. What is the use of break statement?

Ans72. break statement in Python is used to bring the control out of the loop when some external condition is triggered. break statement is put inside the loop body

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?

Ans73. The pass statement is a null statement. But the difference between pass and comment is that comment is ignored by the interpreter whereas pass is not ignored. 

Q74. What is the use of range() function?

Ans74. range() function returns a sequence of numbers, in a given range. The most common use of it is to iterate sequence on a sequence of numbers

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
